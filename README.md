## 🚀 About the Project

**SmartDoc QA** is an intelligent document assistant capable of reading, understanding, and answering questions about any PDF — including scanned documents.  
It combines **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to create a powerful, production-ready pipeline for document analysis.

This project was created as part of the **ISM AI Showcase**, representing how automation and AI can transform real-world workflows in legal, real estate, or enterprise domains.
